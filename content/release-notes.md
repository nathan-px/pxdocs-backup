### Fixes

Portworx, Inc. has fixed the following issues:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PB-627 | Backup location, schedules, pre, and post rule dropdowns showed only 10 entries, even if there were more. <br/><br/> **User impact:** If they had more than 10 entries, users couldn't access them from the dropdowns. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** PX-Backup now shows all results in these dropdowns. |
| PB-623 |	Users were unable to delete restore jobs that were in the pending state. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Users can now delete pending restore jobs. | 
| PB-610 | Due to a race condition between the schedule delete and reconciler status updates, PX-Backup did not delete backup schedules when prompted to. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** PX-Backup now properly deletes backup schedules. |
| PB-608 | Middleware not able to establish a connection with backup because the grpc connection was not closed. <br/><br/> **User impact:** Because of this issue, PX backup was marked as offline. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** Users will no longer see PX-backup marked as `offline` due to the middleware not being able to establish a connection with PX-Backup. |
| PB-599 | Stork continuously retried to update the backup/restore resources when PX-Backup marked a job as failed. <br/><br/> **User impact:** In some cases, Stork would eventually mark the backup CR as successful, but PX-backup would continue to show it as failed. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** PX-backup now accurately reflects the backup CR's status. |
| PB-590 |	Cloud credential information was displayed in plain text in the logs and in the **View JSON** option. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** PX-Backup no longer displays credential information in these places. |
| PB-579 |	Restore jobs sometimes became stuck in the pending state. <br/><br/> **User impact:** Users would see these restore jobs sit in the `pending` state in the PX-Backup UI and never converge to a `failed` state. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** If the restore job is stuck in a `pending` state, it will eventually be marked as failed after the timeout period. |
| PB-578 |	Backup entries were not deleted from the PX-Backup UI when backup sync was in progress and the backup location was deleted <br/><br/> **User impact:** Users would see backup entries from a backup location that was removed from PX-backup UI. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** PX-Backup now deletes these backup entries. |
| PB-569 |	"Successfully" is no longer misspelled in the Restore status dialog. |
| PB-552 |	PX-Backup failed to indicate that users must have admin privileges when adding a Portworx cluster. <br/><br/> **User impact:** Users may not have known why they couldn't add a Portworx cluster. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** In the Portworx endpoint section, a message now indicates that admin account privileges are needed for to add a Portworx cluster for monitoring. |
| PB-541 |	Clusters with PX-Backup disabled were listed on the dropdown in the PX-Backup dashboard <br/><br/> **User impact:** Users may have been confused by these erroneous listings <br/><br/> **Resolution:** PX-Backup no longer lists clusters with PX-Backup disabled. |
| PB-384 |	PX-Backup picked up the existing token when users signed out and attempted to sign in <br/><br/> **User impact:** Users would be directly signed-in when they attempted to log back in and could not switch users if desired. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** PX-Backup now redirects users to the sign-in page after logging out. |
| PB-607 |	It was possible to enter decimal numbers into the schedule dialog. <br/><br/> **Resolution:** The schedule dialog no longer accepts decimal numbers as input. |

### Fixes

Portworx, Inc. has fixed the following issues:

|**Issue Number**|**Issue Description**|
|----|----|
| PB-534 | Clusters could be added to PX-Backup using credentials that did not have adequate permissions.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** PX-Backup would not be able to display data or perform operations properly.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Cluster addition now fails if credentials do not have all of the required permissions. |
| PB-519 | It was possible to attempt to add a backup location before adding a cloud account. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Despite seeing the **+ Add** option, users would not be able to add a backup location.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Users must now add a cloud account before seeing the option to add a backup location. |
| PB-400 | When editing a backup schedule, the existing pre-exec and post-exec rules did not appear in the dialog box.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users would have to reselect their pre-exec and post-exec rules when they edited an existing backup schedule.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** PX-Backup now lists the existing pre-exec and post-exec rules when a user edits a backup schedule. |
| PB-307 | Restores from subsequent backups stored on different buckets from the original that both involve the same namespace failed. <!-- this is tough to explain and I'm not sure I got it right. -->  <br/><br/>**User Impact:** If users created multiple backups and buckets, restores from subsequent backups stored on different buckets from the original that both involve the same namespace failed.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** PX-Backup now properly takes the initial backup for incremental backups, even when they share a namespace with other backups using different buckets. |
| PB-499 | When PX-Backup failed to create a backup, the reason for the failure did not propagate to the UI correctly, showing only the creation failure message. <br/><br/>**User Impact:**  Due to the stuck message, users may have been unable to see the real reason for a backup deletion failure.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** Creation failure messages no longer stick, allowing users to see more recent messages. |
| PB-493 |The PX-Backup UI did not update to reflect invalid underlying backup object statuses.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** If a backup object was deleted, users may still have seen the backup appear as valid on the PX-Backup UI.<br/><br/>**Resolution:** PX-Backup now properly displays the invalid backup status. |
| PB-468 | After the trial license expired, there was no way to let the user know that they had more clusters online on PX-Backup than the license supported until the backup failed.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users would not know they have more cluster than the license supports until their backup or restore failed. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** PX-Backup now displays a message on the home screen to let the users know that they need to remove some clusters if they have more clusters than their license supports. |
| PB-395 | The PX-Backup app view took a long time to load when multiple namespaces were selected. <br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users selecting a large number of namespaces in the app view would either not see, or have to wait a long time for resources to appear <br/><br/>**Resolution:** PX-Backup now loads resources for multiple namespaces faster. |
| PB-486 | When a user deleted a backup, PX-Backup did not update the reason.<br/><br/>**User Impact:** Users may have seen confusing information about their backup status during deletion<br/><br/>**Resolution:** PX-Backup now shows an appropriate message indicating volumes and resources are being deleted. |
| PB-477 | The `enter` key did not work in search box on the **All backups** page. <br/><br/> **User Impact:** Users couldn't filter their results on the **All backups** page using the search box. <br/><br/>**Resolution:** The search box now filters results when a user inputs a term and presses `enter`. | 

<!-- need more info
